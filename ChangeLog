Sun Aug  6 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sat Aug  5 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added support for differentiating Core 2 Duo CPUs from Xeon 
	  5100 CPUs based on the brand string.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that CPUID 4 ECX contains one less than the 
	  number of sets.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 5 ecx & edx.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 6 ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 0xa eax & ebx.
	* cpuid.c: Made CPUID functions 7, 8, and 9 reserved (i.e. say nothing
	  until and unless they are defined).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected CPUID 1 ecx xTPR disabnle.

Wed Aug  2 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected bug with Core 2 Duo recognition.
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish between Allendale and Conroe cores based on
	  L2 cache size.
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA C7 & C7-M names to Esther WinChip C5J core CPUs.
	* cpuid.man: Mention wikipedia pages for CPUs.

Tue Aug  1 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: On help screen, clarified that -f option reads output from 
	  -r option.
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Used %{} macros for external command invocations.

Mon Jul 31 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Removed install -o 0 -g 0 options.  For installations
	  from the tarball, the user will have to be root anyway.  And for
	  rpm, the %defattr() attribute in the spec is handling this more
	  cleanly.  Finally, those options are causing some non-root
	  installations to have to be done by the root user, which is
	  undesirable.
	* cpuid.c: Improved identification for VIA C3 (Samuel WinChip C5A core).
	* cpuid.c: Loosened up check for "Mobile AMD Athlon(tm) XP" by 
	  removing "-M" suffix.
	* cpuid.c: Recognize mobile Athlon XP (Thoroughbred).

Sun Jul 30 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "deterministic cache parameters (4)", so that its
	  children aren't staggered.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Venice and Palermo processors with DH-E3 and
	  DH-E6 steppings that had been reported as Toledo processors
	  incorrectly.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected codename for the Athlon Thoroughbred's Duron
	  counterpart: Applebred.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish Athlon XP Thortons from Bartons,
	  based on L2 cache size.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish Athlon 64 X2 Manchester E6 from
	  Athlon 64 X2 Toledo.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron Yonah C0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core Yonah D0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon Nocona R0 / Irwindale R0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium 4 Cedar Mill C1, Pentium D Presler C1, and 
	  Xeon Dempsey C1.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon Woodcrest B2.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core 2 Conroe B1 & B2 & Core 2 Extreme Processor B1 & 
	  B2.
	* cpuid.c: Updated Itanium2 processors.
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel specification updates for new CPUs.

Wed Jul 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In decode_brand, added check for "Athlon(TM) XP", equivalent 
	  to "Athlon(tm) XP".
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "80000002" typo in print_80860002_eax().  

Mon Jul 24 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish properly between Core Solo, Core Duo, and
	  Xeon Processor LV.  Reorganized multi-processor decoding to
	  support that.

Sun Jul 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed emission of raw values for cpuid code 2.
	* cpuid.c: Added -f file option to read raw hexadecimal input from a
	  file and parse it instead of executing the cpuid instruction, and
	  code reorganization to support this.

Mon May 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "unrecogninzed" typo in error.

Fri Apr  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Added %defattr so that the files in the rpm's are
	  owned by "root" and not "todd".  (Why did no one scream bloody murder
	  about this before?)

Mon Apr  3 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish between the two different Dual-Core
	  Xeon (Paxville A0) and Dual-Core Xeon Processor 7000 (Paxville A0).  
	  Empirically, the significant differences are the VMX flag and the
	  "execution disable" flag.  The VMX flag is in an Intel-defined
	  CPUID function, so it's used.  Thanks to Jason Nicholls for providing
	  the Dual-Core Xeon (Paxville A0) output that made this possible.
	* cpuid.c: Added detection for Xeon Processor LV (Sossaman C0).

Mon Mar 13 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed code that distinguished processors based on
	  presence or absence of L3 cache.  Some of the cache codes weren't
	  being recognized as L3 cache.

Sun Feb 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Feb 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added VMX: virtual machine extensions to CPUID function 1,
	  register ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added SVM LBR virtualization to CPUID function 8000000a,
	  register edx.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed cut & paste header error in print_8000000a_eax.

Tue Feb 21 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Renamed "hyper-threading technology" field to 
	  "hyper-threading / multi-core supported" to eliminate some confusing
	  situations, such as Northwood chips which nominally support hyper-
	  threading, but where it is disabled in the chip; or where hyper-
	  threading is disabled in the BIOS; or AMD multi-core chips, which 
	  indicate TRUE here, but all of which lack hyper-threading at present.
	* cpuid.c: Updated family 15 description, which had grown very stale.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Intel Pentium D Processor 900 to 9x0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Processor Number info to Smithfield processors.

Wed Feb  8 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Use defined(i386) instead of __LONG_MAX__ to determine
	  whether or not it's necessary to use _llseek().  Fixes handling of 
	  functions >= 2**31 on some build systems, like the one I used to 
	  build the binary rpm.  (D'oh!)  And also indirectly affects the
	  (synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Fix a busted error check in read_reg() that caused it to
	  return success if the read() failed and quiet was true.
	* LICENSE: Created LICENSE file (using content straight out of the
	  man page).

Tue Feb  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Correctly distinguish Egypt/Italy processors.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed minor problems in error checking in open_file().
	* cpuid.spec: Fixed bad Packager field.
	* cpuid.spec: Include ChangeLog.
	* cpuid.man: Added -r/--raw description.
	* cpuid.man: Clarified info used for (synth) field.
	* cpuid.man: Fixed version number & date.
	* Makefile: Reworked to make it easy for people other than me to build 
	  and install.
	* cpuid.spec: Used new Makefile organization
	* Makefile: Fixed production of spec file so that it's possible to
	  rebuild with the srpm without having to specify %version and
	  %release.

Mon Feb  6 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Initial public release.
