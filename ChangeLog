	* cpuid.c: Added VMX: virtual machine extensions to CPUID function 1,
	  register ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added SVM LBR virtualization to CPUID function 8000000a,
	  register edx.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed cut & paste header error in print_8000000a_eax.

	* cpuid.c: Renamed "hyper-threading technology" field to 
	  "hyper-threading / multi-core supported" to eliminate some confusing
	  situations, such as Northwood chips which nominally support hyper-
	  threading, but where it is disabled in the chip; or where hyper-
	  threading is disabled in the BIOS; or AMD multi-core chips, which 
	  indicate TRUE here, but all of which lack hyper-threading at present.
	* cpuid.c: Updated family 15 description, which had grown very stale.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Intel Pentium D Processor 900 to 9x0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Processor Number info to Smithfield processors.

	* cpuid.c: Use defined(i386) instead of __LONG_MAX__ to determine
	  whether or not it's necessary to use _llseek().  Fixes handling of 
	  functions >= 2**31 on some build systems, like the one I used to 
	  build the binary rpm.  (D'oh!)  And also indirectly affects the
	  (synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Fix a busted error check in read_reg() that caused it to
	  return success if the read() failed and quiet was true.
	* LICENSE: Created LICENSE file (using content straight out of the
	  man page).

Tue Feb  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>

	* cpuid.c: Correctly distinguish Egypt/Italy processors.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed minor problems in error checking in open_file().
	* cpuid.spec: Fixed bad Packager field.
	* cpuid.spec: Include ChangeLog.
	* cpuid.man: Added -r/--raw description.
	* cpuid.man: Clarified info used for (synth) field.
	* cpuid.man: Fixed version number & date.
	* Makefile: Reworked to make it easy for people other than me to build 
	  and install.
	* cpuid.spec: Used new Makefile organization
	* Makefile: Fixed production of spec file so that it's possible to
	  rebuild with the srpm without having to specify %version and
	  %release.
