	* cpuid.c: Use defined(i386) instead of __LONG_MAX__ to determine
	  whether or not it's necessary to use _llseek().  Fixes handling of 
	  functions >= 2**31 on some build systems, like the one I used to 
	  build the binary rpm.  (D'oh!)  And also indirectly affects the
	  (synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Fix a busted error check in read_reg() that caused it to
	  return success if the read() failed and quiet was true.
	* LICENSE: Created LICENSE file (using content straight out of the
	  man page).

	* cpuid.man: Clarified info used for (synth) field.

	* Makefile: Reworked to make it easy for people other than me to build 
	  and install.
	* cpuid.spec: Used new Makefile organization
	* Makefile: Fixed production of spec file so that it's possible to
