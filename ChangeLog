Fri Mar  4 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Celeron T1000 series, previously missing.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Celeron Mobile P4000, U3000 series.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added current Sandy Bridge processors.

Thu Mar  3 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added detection of PCIDs & TSC-DEADLINE.
	* cpuid.c: Verified Mike Stroyan CPUID 2 cache meanings from Intel CPUID
	  document (241618-037).  Added 0x76 meaning.
	* cpuid.c: Added various new flags from Intel 241618-037.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added AMD family 14h processors.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Updated Intel process id table, mostly as just
	  generalizations.

Tue Nov  9 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Update the usage() screen, since some of its -i and -1
	  comments are incorrect now.

Mon Oct  4 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added AMD Geode LX.
	* cpuid.c: Added NSC Geode GX2 and AMD Geode GX.
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added AMD Geode NX.

Sat Oct  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Intel Atom N500.

Thu Sep 30 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added support for Intel Tolapai (SoC).
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added support for Intel Clarkdale chips from
	  specification update 323179.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized decode_amd_model by adding full brand tables for
	  AMD chips.  If a BIOS doesn't recognize a chip it writes
	  "model unknown" into its brand string via MSR's.
	  decode_override_brand detects that and uses the decode_amd_model brand
	  to differentiate CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected 80000001/ebx PkgType, BrandId, and str1 bit fields.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected problems with brand field decoding because its bit
	  field with differs from architecture to architecture.
	* cpuid.c: decode_amd_model: the partialmodel decrement special case
	  applies only to XF=1,F=15; and not to XF=2,F=15.

Mon Sep 27 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added support for NSC/AMD Geode GX1.

Wed Sep  8 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected the Transmeta processor revisions, which should've
	  been in hex instead of octal.

Thu Sep  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added a couple vague steppings for Transmeta Efficeon TM8000
	  processors.  Updated some transmeta bitfields.  This is all done
	  blind, as I have no examples of these chips, little documentation, and
	  the company is long defunct.

Thu Sep  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed a few header strings that had incorrect function hex
	  codes or registers.

Wed Sep  1 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed buffer size in do_file() to be able to read new
	  raw dumps with ecx information.  It needed a couple more characters.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron M (Yonah D0) & Celeron M (Merom-L1 A1) synth
	  entries.
	* cpuid.c: added Xeon Processor LV (Sossaman D0).
	* cpuid.c: Update Itanium chips in the synth tables.  Sadly, this all
	  still is being done blind, as I have no access to any Itanium chips.
	* cpuid.c: Wrote an x86_64 counterpart to the assembly code for
	  bits_needed().
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Changed to support building for both i386
	  and x86_64.

Tue Aug 31 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Rearranged synth rules and substantially simplified query
	  macros into something like the form I was hoping for when I started
	  this redesign.
	* cpuid.c: Added changes from the new AMD CPUID document that claims to
	  have been released in September 2010!
	* cpuid.c: Changed raw dump to include %ecx values to accomodate CPUID
	  functions with gaps in the useful %ecx range (e.g. 0xd).  The file
	  parser accepts either the old or new forms.
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Updated build scheme for my current
	  systems.
	* LICENSE: Changed to a GPL license.

Mon Aug 30 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Semi-mechanically eliminated the codes used to
	  disambiguate in the synth string and replaced them with queries,
	  which I think will be more general-purpose and will allow me to
	  eliminate a lot of the problem with codes appropriate for one
	  model being a problem for subsequent models (e.g. the Core Solo
	  vs. Core Duo distinction).  There still are general-purpose
	  queries like there were general-purpose codes, but the
	  special-case queries will only matter for those families that
	  care about them.  This does mean that it's possible for multiple
	  queries to register as true, so I have to be more careful with
	  the order of chips in the synth tables.

Fri Aug 27 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Mobile Turion checking in decode_brand.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries for 6/15/4 pre-production
	  Conroe B0/Woodcrest B0.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries for Santa Rosa F3 stepping
	  (undocumented).
	* cpuid.c: Fixed synth entries for Brisbane, Toledo, and Windsor to
	  expect code DA (for dual-core Athlons).
	* cpuid.c: Generalized the check for Intel Extreme Edition chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries Core 2 Quad (Conroe) chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entry for VIA 6/13/0 chip.  Unfortunately, there
	  is no documentation and very little anecdotal evidence of this chip,
	  so the description is vague.
	* cpuid.c: Added addition CPUID function 2 cache codes from Mike
	  Stroyan.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed some cut&paste errors that had EAX where it should
	  have been EBX, as reported by Mike Stroyan
	* cpuid.c: Added very short synth table for SiS chips.  I found no
	  documentation on these, so I just have the one case.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed the (synth) strings for oddball chips, which suffered
	  from a cut&paste error.
	* cpuid.c: Simplified some of the fallback strings that had grown
	  ridiculously long.

Thu Aug 26 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added more logic for Woodcrest pre-production chips.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected synth logic for VIA Antaur chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth for plain vanilla Thoroughbred Athlon.

Wed Aug 25 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed a couple bugs with decoding processor numbers in
	  print_synth_amd_model.

Tue Aug 24 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Further changes to mp_synth decoding, including tracking
	  of the decoding method used (there are around 4 major approaches,
	  depending on how you count).
	* cpuid.c: Added apic_synth decoding to find the appropriate field
	  widths and decode the process local APIC physical ID.  This is useful
	  in its own right, but also helps convince me that many Intel chips
	  really do claim to have hyperthreads even though they don't.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for direct instruction (-i) functionality to
	  report on all CPUs by calling sched_setaffinity to reschedule the
	  process on each CPU.  This is now the default behavior for -i, but
	  it can be overridden with the -1 option.
	* cpuid.c: added Barcelona B1 (undocumented chip) synth decoding.

Mon Aug 23 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Made real_get pass the requested ecx values even when
	  using -k.  Modern linux kernel expect the ecx values in the upper
	  32 bits of the file offset (i.e. lseek64).
	* cpuid.c: Worked out a fallback for determining mp_synth information
	  for Intel chips which lack CPUID function 4.
	* cpuid.c: Added mechanism for determining mp_synth information from
	  CPUID function 11 information if it's available (because if it's
	  present on Intel chips, it's the only reliable way; the older
	  mechanisms return gibberish).

Fri Aug 20 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added to synth even more Nehalem chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added 6/15 model for VIA Nano, but there's very little
	  detailed information on this chip, so that's it.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected some AMD codename confusion from 2006:
	  Dublin->ClawHammer/Odessa, Sonora->Dublin,
	  Palermo(mobile)->Georgetown/Sonora, Lancaster->Lancaster/Richmond,
	  Richmond->Taylor/Trinidad.
	* cpuid.c: Overhauled the AMD model dumping code to understand new
	  families.
	* cpuid.c: Tweaked decode_mp_synth to use ApicIdCoreIdSize, per AMD's
	  CPUID recommendations.

Thu Aug 19 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for Intel Xeons.
	* cpuid.c: Removed all the "How to distinguish" comments, since
	  it seems to be very common for Intel to have indistinguishable
	  processors nowadays (the old cache-checking tricks are unreliable
	  now).
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added to synth additional Nehalem chips as I'm
	  able to hunt them down.

Wed Aug 18 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for Intel Core 2, Atom,
	  Celeron, and Pentium chips based on the same cores.

Tue Aug 17 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for AMD family 10h (K10)
	  and family 11h processors.
	* cpuid.c: simplified print_x_synth_amd by pruning its table down to
	  just the three families that differ from normal 1/eax simple synth,
	  and falling back on 1/eax simple synth otherwise.

Mon Aug 16 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added new steppings to synth tables using latest spec
	  updates for all AMD processor families already in them.
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for AMD family 0Fh (K8)
	  processors.

Fri Aug 13 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated raw data dump based on latest CPUID documentation
	  from Intel & AMD.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed dump of function 4 to iterate over all caches.

Thu Aug 12 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Reorganized synth tables to always use extended family
	  and extended model numbers since they are so prevalent on modern
	  chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added new steppings to synth tables using latest spec
	  updates for all Intel processor families already in them.

Sun Nov 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Core 2 Extreme Edition from brand string.
	  Thanks to Tony Freitas for explaining that Ennnn means desktop while
	  Xnnnn means Extreme Edition for those processors.

Wed Nov 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Itanium2 Montecito C2.
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Core 2 Duo Mobile (Conroe B2).
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Quad-Core Xeon Processor 5300 (Woodcrest B3)
	  and Intel Core 2 Extreme Quad-Core Processor QX6700 (Woodcrest B3).
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Celeron D Processor 36x (Cedar Mill D0).
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish Core 2 Duo from Core 2 Extreme Edition based on
	  presence or absence of hyperthreading.  Thanks to Tony Seacow for
	  providing output for numerous processors and the advice about
	  hyperthreading.

Thu Nov  2 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed "number of logical CPU cores - 1" to "number of CPU
	  cores - 1".

Sun Sep 17 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Made the cpuid instruction (-i, --inst options) the default.
	* cpuid.c: Added -k, --kernel option to cause the kernel module to be
	   used.
	* cpuid.c: Removed confusing CPU number from output when using
	  the cpuid instruction.
	* cpuid.man: Updated with new options.
	* cpuid.c, Makefile: Changed i386 _llseek kludge to workaround
	  offsets >= 0x80000000.  Now using -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 in the
	  Makefile instead.  This should allow the i386 cpuid to work on
	  an x86_64 system.
	* cpuid.c: Added knowledge of CPU modules to synthesized field: Tulsa,
	  Woodcrest B1 (pre-production)
	* cpuid.c: In synthesized model field, properly distinguish between
	  Intel Pentium D Processor 8x0 and Intel Pentium Extreme Edition
	  Processor 840 (both Smithfields).
	* cpuid.man: Added mention of new 7100 series spec updates.
	* cpuid.spec: Changed Copyright to License.

Thu Aug 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Removed unnecessary one_cpu argument from do_file.
	* cpuid.c: Added -v option to display version number.

Wed Aug 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Tue Aug 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added -i option to use the CPUID instruction
	  directly instead of the CPUID kernel module.
	* cpuid.c: Change Pentium Processor 9x0 to 9xx because of 9x5
	  processors.
	* cpuid.man: Updated information about determining synthesized model
	  information, and added information about determining synthesized
	  multiprocessor information.

Mon Aug  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Change URL to cpuid-specific page.

Sun Aug  6 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sat Aug  5 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added support for differentiating Core 2 Duo CPUs from Xeon
	  5100 CPUs based on the brand string.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that CPUID 4 ECX contains one less than the
	  number of sets.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 5 ecx & edx.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 6 ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 0xa eax & ebx.
	* cpuid.c: Made CPUID functions 7, 8, and 9 reserved (i.e. say nothing
	  until and unless they are defined).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected CPUID 1 ecx xTPR disabnle.

Wed Aug  2 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected bug with Core 2 Duo recognition.
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish between Allendale and Conroe cores based on
	  L2 cache size.
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA C7 & C7-M names to Esther WinChip C5J core CPUs.
	* cpuid.man: Mention wikipedia pages for CPUs.

Tue Aug  1 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: On help screen, clarified that -f option reads output from
	  -r option.
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Used %{} macros for external command invocations.

Mon Jul 31 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Removed install -o 0 -g 0 options.  For installations
	  from the tarball, the user will have to be root anyway.  And for
	  rpm, the %defattr() attribute in the spec is handling this more
	  cleanly.  Finally, those options are causing some non-root
	  installations to have to be done by the root user, which is
	  undesirable.
	* cpuid.c: Improved identification for VIA C3 (Samuel WinChip C5A core).
	* cpuid.c: Loosened up check for "Mobile AMD Athlon(tm) XP" by
	  removing "-M" suffix.
	* cpuid.c: Recognize mobile Athlon XP (Thoroughbred).

Sun Jul 30 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "deterministic cache parameters (4)", so that its
	  children aren't staggered.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Venice and Palermo processors with DH-E3 and
	  DH-E6 steppings that had been reported as Toledo processors
	  incorrectly.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected codename for the Athlon Thoroughbred's Duron
	  counterpart: Applebred.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish Athlon XP Thortons from Bartons,
	  based on L2 cache size.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish Athlon 64 X2 Manchester E6 from
	  Athlon 64 X2 Toledo.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron Yonah C0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core Yonah D0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon Nocona R0 / Irwindale R0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium 4 Cedar Mill C1, Pentium D Presler C1, and
	  Xeon Dempsey C1.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon Woodcrest B2.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core 2 Conroe B1 & B2 & Core 2 Extreme Processor B1 &
	  B2.
	* cpuid.c: Updated Itanium2 processors.
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel specification updates for new CPUs.

Wed Jul 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In decode_brand, added check for "Athlon(TM) XP", equivalent
	  to "Athlon(tm) XP".
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "80000002" typo in print_80860002_eax().

Mon Jul 24 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish properly between Core Solo, Core Duo, and
	  Xeon Processor LV.  Reorganized multi-processor decoding to
	  support that.

Sun Jul 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed emission of raw values for cpuid code 2.
	* cpuid.c: Added -f file option to read raw hexadecimal input from a
	  file and parse it instead of executing the cpuid instruction, and
	  code reorganization to support this.

Mon May 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "unrecogninzed" typo in error.

Fri Apr  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Added %defattr so that the files in the rpm's are
	  owned by "root" and not "todd".  (Why did no one scream bloody murder
	  about this before?)

Mon Apr  3 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish between the two different Dual-Core
	  Xeon (Paxville A0) and Dual-Core Xeon Processor 7000 (Paxville A0).
	  Empirically, the significant differences are the VMX flag and the
	  "execution disable" flag.  The VMX flag is in an Intel-defined
	  CPUID function, so it's used.  Thanks to Jason Nicholls for providing
	  the Dual-Core Xeon (Paxville A0) output that made this possible.
	* cpuid.c: Added detection for Xeon Processor LV (Sossaman C0).

Mon Mar 13 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed code that distinguished processors based on
	  presence or absence of L3 cache.  Some of the cache codes weren't
	  being recognized as L3 cache.

Sun Feb 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Feb 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added VMX: virtual machine extensions to CPUID function 1,
	  register ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added SVM LBR virtualization to CPUID function 8000000a,
	  register edx.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed cut & paste header error in print_8000000a_eax.

Tue Feb 21 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Renamed "hyper-threading technology" field to
	  "hyper-threading / multi-core supported" to eliminate some confusing
	  situations, such as Northwood chips which nominally support hyper-
	  threading, but where it is disabled in the chip; or where hyper-
	  threading is disabled in the BIOS; or AMD multi-core chips, which
	  indicate TRUE here, but all of which lack hyper-threading at present.
	* cpuid.c: Updated family 15 description, which had grown very stale.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Intel Pentium D Processor 900 to 9x0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Processor Number info to Smithfield processors.

Wed Feb  8 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Use defined(i386) instead of __LONG_MAX__ to determine
	  whether or not it's necessary to use _llseek().  Fixes handling of
	  functions >= 2**31 on some build systems, like the one I used to
	  build the binary rpm.  (D'oh!)  And also indirectly affects the
	  (synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Fix a busted error check in read_reg() that caused it to
	  return success if the read() failed and quiet was true.
	* LICENSE: Created LICENSE file (using content straight out of the
	  man page).

Tue Feb  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Correctly distinguish Egypt/Italy processors.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed minor problems in error checking in open_file().
	* cpuid.spec: Fixed bad Packager field.
	* cpuid.spec: Include ChangeLog.
	* cpuid.man: Added -r/--raw description.
	* cpuid.man: Clarified info used for (synth) field.
	* cpuid.man: Fixed version number & date.
	* Makefile: Reworked to make it easy for people other than me to build
	  and install.
	* cpuid.spec: Used new Makefile organization
	* Makefile: Fixed production of spec file so that it's possible to
	  rebuild with the srpm without having to specify %version and
	  %release.

Mon Feb  6 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Initial public release.
